# Azure Pipelines Environment Demo.

Azure Pipelines have feature "Environment" I could not find a neat example anywhere. Here is complete flow of Azure Environments. 

I have modeled Azure Pipeline with following features.

+ Submodules
+ Multiple Stages
+ Environment Deployment based success of stage 


Success / Failures are simulated based on a random number.


You can do Gating / Approval in your azure devops environment.

This is tested on Azure Devops (cloud version) only.
